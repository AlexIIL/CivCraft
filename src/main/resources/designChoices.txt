Notes:
	-Beaker earning rate is constant, the cost of techs increases the higher the tier
	-Boost effects may be made possible, not sure (either that or a way of automating research to get beakers, so you can get more techs over time)
	-All wooden material tools can be craftable from the get go- however their stats are lowered until you research the right tech for them 
		(except for hoes, as they all do the same damn thing, and pickaxes, as you can get stone before you have researched mining, but you can always make axes and swords-
		it would be too annoying not being able to defend yourself)
	-All stone tools are disabled until you research both the required tech for that, and masonary
	-Bronze working (normal civ tech tree) is replaced by iron working- unless any mod exists that adds tin and copper, in which case iron working is moved after bronze working
	-Sailing no longer requires pottery, as pottery now also requires smelting
